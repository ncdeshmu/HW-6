Additionally, another source states that \"purr\" functions have \"consistent naming\".\n\n#SOURCES:\n#https://purrr.tidyverse.org/ \n#https://purrr.tidyverse.org/articles/base.html\n\n\n# A side-effect function is a function that happens as a result of something, but however, is not returned.\n\n\n#You can name a variable \"sd\" in a function, and not cause any issues with the \"sd\" function, as long as you use the variable in different ways. \n\nTask 2 - Writing R Functions\n\n#set.seed(10)\n#n &lt;- 100\n#x &lt;- runif(n)\n#resp &lt;- 3 + 10 * x + rnorm(n)\n#pred &lt;- predict(lm(resp ~ x), data.frame(x))\n\n\n#getMRSE(resp, pred)\n\n\n#getMAE(resp, pred)\n\nLet’s create a wrapper function that can be used to get either or both metrics returned with a single function call. Do not rewrite your above two functions, call them inside the wrapper function (we would call the getRMSE() and getMAE() functions helper functions). When returning your values, give them appropriate names. • The function should check that two numeric (atomic) vectors have been passed (consider is.vector(), is.atomic(), and is.numeric()). If not, a message should print and the function should exit. • The function should return both metrics by default and include names. The behavior should be able to be changed using a character string of metrics to find.\n\n#wrapper &lt;- function(getRMSE(), getMAE())\n\nTask 3\n\n#install.packages('httr')\n\n\n#url &lt;- httr::GET(\"https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=gamestop&from=2024-10-01&language=en&pageSize=100&apiKey=myKeyGoesHere\")\n\n\n#purrr::pluck(url, articles)\n\n\n# Creating contingency table from vec using table()\n#conTable = table(articles)\n#print(conTable)\n\n\n#install.package(\"lubridate\")\n\n\n#pub_diff &lt;- lag(mutate(time))\n\n\n#map(pub_diff)\n#map(publishedAt)"
